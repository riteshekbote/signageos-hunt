[HYP] Cross-tenant IDOR via organizationUid on api.signageos.io /v1
class: IDOR
asset: api.signageos.io/v1/{device,organization,alert,...}
confidence: 60
reasoning: 19 routes confirmed present (403-only, no auth header). SDK appends `organizationUid` query param to JWT calls and builds `apiUrl/version/resource`; JWT identifies account, UID selects tenant — if authorization is per-JWT and not re-checked per-UID, cross-org reads/writes are possible. Untestable without a token.
evidence_needed: valid `X-Auth` JWT + observed 200 vs 403 for a foreign `organizationUid`.
verify_steps: AUTH_HELPED: with a box-generated token, `GET https://api.signageos.io/v1/device` (own org), then `GET /v1/device?organizationUid=<other-org-uid>` and `GET /v1/organization/<foreign-uid>` — any non-403 is a finding.
impact: cross-tenant device/org data disclosure and manipulation; CRITICAL
testability: AUTH_HELPED
[HYP] Device-scoped endpoint auth weaker than user JWT on telemetry/alive/peer-recovery
class: AUTH
asset: api.signageos.io/v1/device/{uid}/telemetry/latest
confidence: 45
reasoning: device-side resources (`telemetry/latest`, `device/{uid}/alive`, `peer-recovery`) may accept device tokens or no-auth in device onboarding path; `device/telemetry/latest` confirmed 403 today but subresource matrix unprobed.
evidence_needed: any `/v1/device/*` subresource returning ≠403 unauthenticated.
verify_steps: PASSIVE: `GET /v1/device/<uid>/alive`, `/v1/device/<uid>/peer-recovery`, `/v1/device/<uid>/organization` (no header) — 403 confirms route, 200/401-with-different-error hints alternate auth.
impact: unauthenticated device state/telemetry read; MEDIUM
testability: PASSIVE
[HYP] Box dashboard token-generation surface over-scopes API credentials
class: AUTH
asset: box.signageos.io/settings
confidence: 45
reasoning: CLI docs direct users to `box.signageos.io/settings` to mint `SOS_API_IDENTIFICATION`/`SOS_API_SECURITY_TOKEN`; box is in-scope and CSP `connect-src` includes `api.signageos.io`, so box is the token minting origin. If minted tokens lack scope/expiry constraints, any XSS/CSRF on box amplifies to full API.
evidence_needed: authenticated inspection of the token-minting XHR (scopes, expiry, org binding).
verify_steps: AUTH_HELPED: login to box, observe XHR to `api.signageos.io/v1/*` from box origin in devtools, test whether minted token honors `organizationUid` and expiry.
impact: over-scoped long-lived API creds enabling cross-org access; HIGH
testability: AUTH_HELPED
[PARKED] Auth0 redirect_uri validation bypass @ box/login: no longer actionable — Auth0 tenant-side allowlist, not testable passively (already learned).
[PARKED] JWT audience=Auth0 Management API v2 confusion: audience string is public but minting a Management-API token requires tenant credentials; no passive POC. confidence <45.
[FINAL] 1) Cross-tenant IDOR via organizationUid (60, AUTH_HELPED)  2) Device-scoped endpoint auth bypass (45, PASSIVE)  3) Box token-generation over-scope (45, AUTH_HELPED)
[NEXT] RAG: fetch public REST-API docs `https://docs.signageos.io/hc/en-us/articles/4405231278482` (REST APIs) and `https://docs.signageos.io/hc/en-us/articles/4405239033234` (REST-API-Authentication) to extract the complete v1/v2 endpoint catalog + any unauthenticated/token-less endpoints, then re-probe only non-403 candidates on api.signageos.io.
[RISK] box.signageos.io: 72 — Auth0 OAuth2 dashboard, API-token minting origin, broad CSP trust boundary (20+ origins incl. device/upload/remote-desktop APIs); exposure stable.
[RISK] api.signageos.io: 78 — previously dismissed as "no surface", now confirmed versioned JWT API (19+ routes, device-management data, cross-tenant IDOR potential); risk materially raised.

[HYP] Cross-tenant org-token minting via account token
class: IDOR
asset: api.signageos.io/v1/organization/{organizationUID}/security-token (GET/POST)
confidence: 55
reasoning: Spec marks this XAuthAccount-only; org UID is a path key. Account token scopes to a Company, yet docs say one account token "can create multiple organizations" and mint org tokens. If company-membership is not re-checked per UID, any account token mints tokens for any org, and org tokens fully control devices (brightness/firmware/content/timing).
evidence_needed: 200 (not 403) on the foreign-UID path with own account token.
verify_steps: AUTH_HELPED: `GET https://api.signageos.io/v1/organization/<own-org>/security-token` (baseline 200), then `GET /v1/organization/<foreign-org-uid>/security-token` — 200 = cross-tenant token mint → full device control of foreign org.
impact: mint org tokens for any tenant → device/content/timing takeover; CRITICAL
testability: AUTH_HELPED
[HYP] Account-token filtered listing ignores tenant scope (organizationUid/companyUid)
class: IDOR
asset: api.signageos.io/v1/organization (GET), /v1/emulator (GET), /v1/device (GET)
confidence: 50
reasoning: account-token listing endpoints take `organizationUid(s)`/`companyUid` as free filters; docs explicitly require organizationUid for org-scoped listing with account tokens. If the filter is applied without a "filter ∈ my company" check, account tokens read foreign tenants' org/device/emulator data.
evidence_needed: 200 with non-empty foreign data for a foreign uid filter.
verify_steps: AUTH_HELPED: `GET /v1/organization?companyUid=<foreign>` and `GET /v1/device?organizationUid=<foreign>` with own account token — non-403/empty is a finding.
impact: cross-tenant device/org/telemetry disclosure; HIGH
testability: AUTH_HELPED
[HYP] Credentials exposed in query string on account-token mint
class: MISCONFIG
asset: api.signageos.io/v1/account/security-token (POST/DELETE)
confidence: 45
reasoning: `identification` + `password` defined as **query** params (spec) on a POST behind CloudFront — user credentials land in URL logs/referrers; alternate auth path bypasses normal session flow.
evidence_needed: confirmed CloudFront/access-log capture of query creds (infra-side, not provable passively) + spec-level confirmation of param location.
verify_steps: AUTH_HELPED: with org token, POST `/v1/account/security-token?identification=<u>&password=<p>` and inspect request/response + any logging headers.
impact: credential leakage via shared-infra logs; MEDIUM
testability: AUTH_HELPED
[NEXT] RAG: fetch `github.com/signageos/sdk` source to confirm exact `X-Auth` construction for v1/v2, the account-token mint call shape (`identification`/`password` param placement), and whether `createApiV2` reuses v1 auth/orgUid semantics — converts hypothesis 1/2 into exact AUTH_HELPED test recipes.
